hmpl is a small template language for displaying UI from server to client. It is based on <em>customizable</em> requests sent to the server via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch</a> and processed into ready-made HTML. The language is syntactically object-based and integrated with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/json5">JSON5</a>. Reduce the size of your javascript files and display the same UI as if it was written in a modern framework and apply Server-Side Rendering, Static Site Generation, Incremental Static Generation (SSR, SSG, ISG) without robot indexing on any sites without Next.js, Remix, Nuxt.js!

☆ If you find HMPL useful, please consider giving us a star on GitHub! Your support helps us continue to innovate and deliver exciting features.

## Usage

```javascript
import hmpl from "hmpl-js";

const templateFn = hmpl.compile(
  `<div>
      <button data-action="increment" id="btn">Click!</button>
      <div>Clicks: {{ src: "/api/clicks", after: "click:#btn" }}</div>
  </div>`
);

const clicker = templateFn(({ request: { event } }) => ({
  body: JSON.stringify({ action: event.target.getAttribute("data-action") })
})).response;

document.querySelector("#app").append(clicker);
```

## Why HMPL?

Using template language capabilities, you can multiply reduce the size of the application bundle. Full customization of the request based on the modern `fetch` standard, as well as support for all the functionality necessary for modern work in applications (request indicator, sending by event, automatic generation of `body` for the `form`, caching) and the syntax of the object in the markup, which requires a minimum number of characters, will help to build interaction with the server and client as efficiently as possible.

Also, HMPL can serve as an excellent alternative to such popular tools as HTMX and Alpine.js.

## Features

- **Customizable**: Send a custom request to the server when receiving the UI
- **Memory Preserving**: Reduce file sizes on the client by [several times](https://github.com/hmpl-language/app-size-comparison)
- **Based on Fetch API**: Use a modern standard instead of `XMLHTTPRequest`
- **Server-oriented**: Work with the server directly through markup and with a little js
- **Generate thousands of DOM nodes from a single template**: Work with large components not only on the server but also on the client
- **Simple**: Get ready-made UI from the server by writing a couple of lines of familiar object syntax
- **Flexible**: Can be used in almost any project due to not only working through a script, but also working in files with the `.hmpl` extension
- **Integrated with JSON5**: Flexible writing of objects by [specs](https://spec.json5.org) as in vanilla js, as well as the reliability of the parser used by millions of people.
- **Small bundle size**: Lots of functionality in a couple of kilobytes

## Installation

hmpl can be installed in several ways, which are described in this section. This tool is a simple javascript file that is connected in the usual way through a `script`, or using the `import` construct in an environment that supports this (webpack build, parcel build etc.). Also, starting from version `2.2.0`, the connection of the JSON5 module is required. The first and easiest way is to install using a CDN.

### Package Manager

This method involves downloading through npm or other package managers.

```bash
npm i hmpl-js
```

> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required for npm.

Along the path node-modules/hmpl/dist you can find two files that contain a regular js file and a minified one.

### CDN

This method involves connecting the file through a third-party resource, which provides the ability to obtain a javascript file from npm via a link.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/json5/dist/index.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/hmpl-js/dist/hmpl.min.js"></script>
<!--
  integrity="sha384-..."
  crossorigin="anonymous"
-->
```

This resource could be unpkg, skypack or other resources. The examples include unpkg simply because it is one of the most popular and its url by characters is not so long.

### Manual download

You can install the package by simply [downloading](https://unpkg.com/hmpl-js/dist/hmpl.min.js) it as a file and moving it to the project folder.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/json5/dist/index.js"></script>
<script src="./hmpl.min.js"></script>
```

If, for some reason, you do not need the minified file, then you can download the full file from this [link](https://unpkg.com/hmpl-js/dist/hmpl.js).

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/json5/dist/index.js"></script>
<script src="./hmpl.js"></script>
```

The non-minified file is larger in size, but it is there as it is with all the formatting.
