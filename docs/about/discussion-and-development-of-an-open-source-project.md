# Discussion and development of an open-source project

There are several official social media channels for discussing the project, where you can ask your question, suggest improvements, and much more.

The first such platform, of course, is [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/hmpl-language/hmpl/discussions), where you can raise a discussion on a particular topic related to the project.

You can find more interesting content about the module itself on the [Twitter (X.com) page](https://x.com/hmpljs). It sometimes publishes announcements of new versions, ideas for new features, surveys, and more.

Also, if the GitHub discussion format is not suitable for you, then you can log into the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/KFunMep36n).

We will be glad to welcome you in the community!
